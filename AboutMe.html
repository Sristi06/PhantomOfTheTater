I was born in Bristol, in England, in St. Michael's Hospital on June 12 2004. When I was around the age of three, I moved back to my parents and brother’s birthplace, India. After two years, my father found a new job and this time we moved to America, New Jersey

When I first went to an actual school for a full 5 hours, I was excited. The school I went to was a small building, a kindergarten built a few meters away for the elementary school. At first, it was hard to understand english, as I had never needed to speak that language before. To help us, a few other new students and I were placed into an ESL class for an hour a day. I was the first to graduate my ESL class, as the rest of my family knew enough english to get by.

When I had just started 2nd grade, I learned that my family and I were moving yet again to California. This meant I had to leave some of my best friends behind, and that was sad. Many classmates told me that California was sunny even in the winter.(there was snow in NJ) This didn’t change my mind.

Now, nearly 5 years later, I am a middle schooler at Joaquin Miller Middle School in California. This website Is something I created as part of a school club, Girls Who Code. Obviously, I didn’t code this, I made it with a premade theme, but I did code the website you seemed to be checking out about 2 minutes ago. I hope you liked it!
