How to code a website
</h1>

<p>
In this tab, I thought I would show everyone how to code a simple website. Let's begin!
</p>

<p>
First off, you want to find a place to code. JS Fiddle is a good one but I highly reccomend Github. It's slow and you have to refresh to see you progress, but it turns into a real website in the end.
</p>

<p>
Next, we will start with a tag called !DOCTYPE html           Tip:Tags have carrots <example> around them, so if I say tag, you know what to do!
</p>

<p>
Enter a tab down and make another tag, this time a html tag. You have to close this tab, though.     Tip: When I say close, I mean add a backslash (/) in the tag. So, basically, you should have two tags, one without a backslash, which is on top, and one with a backslash on the bottom.
</p>

<p>
Now in between your html tags, add a body tag and don't forget to close it!
</p>

<p>
Your Code should look something like this:
</p>

<p>
!DOCTYPE html
</p>

<p>
html
</p>

<p>
body
</p>

<p>
/body
</p>

<p>
/html
</p>

<p>
Look similar? If not, it's probably because you can't see the carrots that go around the tags. Please, please, pleeease remember to add those on your own. Still doesn't look familiar? edit your code and play around!
</p>

<p>
Okay, moving on, next you want to code between the body tag all of your content, which is, well, the body!
</p>

<p>
If you want a heading for your website, listen up. We're gonna make another tag. Call it h1 and put it indie your body tag. Don't forget to close it. In between the h1 tag, you want to write your header. It can be "How to code a website', for example *wink, wink* You don't need to add a tag around your text.
</p>

<p>
  If you want paragraphs, you se a tag called p. That's it. Don't forget to close it and put inside your body tag, right after your header. write your paragraph in your p tag.
</p>

<p>
  This is what your code should look like:
</p>

<p>
!DOCTYPE html
</p>

<p>
html
</p>

<p>
body
</p>

<p>
  h1
</p>

<p>
  *Example header*
</p>

<p>
  /h1
</p>

<p>
  p
</p>

<p>
  *Example paragraph*
</p>

<p>
  /p
</p>

<p>
/body
</p>

<p>
/html
</p>
