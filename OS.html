How to code a website
</h1>

<p>
In this tab, I thought I would show everyone how to code a simple website. Let's begin!
</p>

<p>
First off, you want to find a place to code. JS Fiddle is a good one but I highly reccomend Github. It's slow and you have to refresh to see you progress, but it turns into a real website in the end.
</p>

<p>
Next, we will start with a tag called <!DOCTYPE html> Tip:Tags have carrots around them, so if I say tag, you know what to do!
</p>

<p>
Enter a tab down and make another tag, this time a <html> tag. You have to close this tab, though. Tip: When I say close, I mean add a backslash (/) in the tag. So, basically, you should have two tags, one without a baclslash, which is on top, and one with a backslash on the bottom.
</p>

<p>
Now in between your html tags, add a <body> tag and don't forget to close it!
</p>

<p>
Your Code should look something like this:
</p>

<p>
<!DOCTYPE html>
</p>

<p>
<html>
</p>

<p>
<body>
</p>

<p>
</body>
</p>

<p>
</html>
</p>

<p>
Look similar? If not, edit your code and play around!
</p>

<p>
Okay, moving on, next you want to code between the <body> tag all of your content, which is, well, the body!
</p>

<p>

</p>

</body>
</html>
