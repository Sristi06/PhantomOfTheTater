<h1>
How To Code a Website
</h1>

<p>
In this tab, I thought I would show everyone how to code a simple website. Let's begin!
</p>

<p>
First off, you want to find a place to code. JS Fiddle is a good one but I highly reccomend Github. It's slow and you have to refresh to see you progress, but it turns into a real website in the end.
</p>

<p>
Next, we will start with a tag called !DOCTYPE html           Tip:Tags have carrots < > around them, so if I say tag, you know what to do!
</p>

<p>
Enter a tab down and make another tag, this time a html tag. You have to close this tab, though.     Tip: When I say close, I mean add a backslash (/) in the tag. So, basically, you should have two tags, one without a backslash, which is on top, and one with a backslash on the bottom.
</p>

<p>
Now in between your html tags, add a body tag and don't forget to close it!
</p>

<p>
Your Code should look something like this:
</p>

<p>
!DOCTYPE html
</p>

<p>
html
</p>

<p>
body
</p>

<p>
/body
</p>

<p>
/html
</p>

<p>
Look similar? If not, it's probably because you can't see the carrots that go around the tags. Please, please, pleeease remember to add those on your own. Still doesn't look familiar? Edit your code and play around!
</p>

<p>
Okay, moving on, next you want to code between the body tag all of your content, which is, well, the body!
</p>

<p>
If you want a heading for your website, listen up. We're gonna make another tag. Call it h1 and put it inside your body tag. Don't forget to close it. In between the h1 tag, you want to write your header. It can be "How to code a website', for example *wink, wink* You don't need to add a tag around your text.
</p>

<p>
  If you want paragraphs, you se a tag called p. That's it. Don't forget to close it and put inside your body tag, right after your header. write your paragraph in your p tag.
</p>

<p>
  This is what your code should look like:
</p>

<p>
!DOCTYPE html
</p>

<p>
html
</p>

<p>
body
</p>

<p>
  h1
</p>

<p>
  *Example header*
</p>

<p>
  /h1
</p>

<p>
  p
</p>

<p>
  *Example paragraph*
</p>

<p>
  /p
</p>

<p>
/body
</p>

<p>
/html
</p>

<p>
 Now, once again, don't forget the carrots.  Also, the * around the text is not necessary.
</p>

<p>
  That's it! You have created your first website! Click "run" if your on JS Fiddle or "Commit Changes" if you're on Github. Next up, we're going to focus on adding images and css, a cascading style sheet.
</p>

<p>
  Ok, Now that you have all your paragraphs and headers (you can add as many as you want), we will move on to images. First off, you wanna find a link to a good image. Ctrl C, or copy it onto your clipboard. The tag we are going to use is img src="example image link". Remember to add quotes around the link and carotts around the whole thing. You do not need to end this tag.  
</p>

<p>
  If the image does not show up, try another url or check your code. There should be a space between the quotes and the equal sign. Now we are going on to css, how to align and decorate your text
</p>

<p>
  Your code should look like this:
</p>

<p>
!DOCTYPE html
</p>

<p>
html
</p>

<p>
body
</p>

<p>
  h1
</p>

<p>
  *Example header*
</p>

<p>
  /h1
</p>

<p>
  p
</p>

<p>
  *Example paragraph*
</p>

<p>
  /p
</p>

<p>
  img src= "example link"
</p>

<p>
/body
</p>

<p>
/html
</p>

<p>
 Now, for css. If you are on JS Fiddle, swich to the css box next to the html box. Github users, this is a little harder. Make a new file and call it something.css. I liked to call mine Me.css or Style.css. Next, after the open html tag, make a head tag right under (close the head tag) it and inside of it write the tag: link rel="stylesheet" href="example.css" with carrots around it
</p>

<p>
  The top of your code should look something like this:

!DOCTYPE html
</p>
<p>
 head 
</p>

</p>
link rel="stylesheet" href="example.css"
<p>

<p>
  /head
</p>

<p>
html
</p>

<p>
  Remember, this is just the top of the html code and don't forget your carrots. Now, switch back to your css. We will code there from now on.
</p>

<p>
  css coding is a bit different from real coding. For starters, there are no tags, only these brackets {}
</p>

<p>
  To align everything, you need to align the body. First, at the top of your css, type body {. Don't forget the bracket next to body. Enter down two lines and then type the closing bracket. It is between the two brackets we will code for now. You can also make only one paragraph center by replacing the word body with p.
</p>

<p>
  In between the brackets, type text-align:center;. Don't forget the colon and semicolon. To change the color of your website, enter down, and type background: pink or purple. Choose a color and see if it works
</p>

<p>
  Commit or Run the changes and see the output. If it doesn't work check the code below:
</p>

<p>
  body{
</p>

<p>
  text-align: center;
</p>

<p>
  background: example color;
</p>

<p>
  }
</p>

<p>
  That's it! You have coded your first website! Congrats! Keep adding to your websites and explore the code behind my on website by doing ctrl+shift+i.
